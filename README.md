# RustYoloBench

## Overview
`RustYoloBench` is an innovative project designed to benchmark machine learning frameworks in Rust, particularly focusing on running YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for real-time object detection. This repository compares popular Rust-based frameworks such as `tract`, `burn`, and `candle`, specifically with their capabilities to load and run ONNX models.

## Features
- **Framework Comparison**: Compare performance across different Rust-based machine learning frameworks.
- **ONNX Model Support**: Utilize ONNX models for object detection tasks.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Process data from a live webcam feed using YOLO.
- **Interactive Web Frontend**: Built with Yew, the frontend allows users to select between frameworks and view the output in real time.
- **Performance Metrics**: Frame per second (FPS) rates are displayed for each framework to aid in performance comparison.
